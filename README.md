# Record Data
Use the application to record every log that is cut, it's species, the date it was cut as well as its measurements are taken etc. A unique identifier is the issued to the log so that it can be tracked through the supply chain. 

## PHOTOS & GPS
Photos and GPS locations can also be taken and the data is synced directly to the cloud when the mobile phone is in range of an internet connection. 

## OFFLINE & CLOUD SYNC
This mobile application works offline and the data is then synced to the cloud when an internet connection is established.


# Manage Data
The application can be used by multiple mobile phone operators offline to manage information about all the forestry logging information. 

As this data is synced to the cloud the information can then be synced back to the mobile phone users who can have a holistic view of what's going on in near real-time.

# Map Data
Due to the use of GPS location the mobile application will track where each log was logged from so you know exactly where each log was harvested from, when it was harvested, what species it was and how big it was.

# Track Delivery
Use our vehicle monitoring system to track the delivery of logs using real time GPS tracking of logging trucks. These can be tracked via smart phones or specialised GPS units installed in the trucks.
